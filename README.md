## Metapi2 Demo

This repository contains a small Streamlit application for experimenting with
chunking and clustering text using OpenAI embeddings. The app can now also
compute a **weight** for each chunk based on its cosine similarity to the
average embedding. The weights are softmaxâ€‘normalized so they sum to one and
allow you to see which parts of your prompt are most influential. The UI shows
chunks ordered by weight and assembles a weighted prompt accordingly.
