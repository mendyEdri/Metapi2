## Metapi2 Demo

This repository contains a small Streamlit application for experimenting with
chunking and clustering text using OpenAI embeddings. The app can now also
compute a **weight** for each chunk based on its cosine similarity to the
average embedding. The weights are softmaxâ€‘normalized so they sum to one and
allow you to see which parts of your prompt are most influential. The UI shows
chunks ordered by weight and assembles a weighted prompt accordingly.

Beyond weighting, the helper functions in :mod:`clustering` let you build a
similarity graph between chunks and rank them using classic centrality metrics
such as PageRank or betweenness centrality. This makes it easy to identify the
most connected or influential pieces of a prompt.

By default the app attempts to parse the provided prompt as XML and clusters
the textual content of the XML elements. If the input isn't valid XML it falls
back to a plain text splitting strategy using LangChain's
``RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter``.
