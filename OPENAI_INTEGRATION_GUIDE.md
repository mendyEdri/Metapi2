# 🤖 OpenAI Integration Guide

## ✅ **System Prompt Handling Confirmed**

Your attention flow analysis demo now **correctly passes the current system prompt to OpenAI** for testing!

## 🔧 **What Was Added**

### **📋 System Prompt Visibility**
- **Clear Display**: Shows exactly which system prompt will be sent to OpenAI
- **Character Count**: Displays prompt length and estimated token count
- **Expandable Section**: "📄 System Prompt Being Tested" shows full content
- **Model Confirmation**: Shows which model will receive the prompt

### **🔍 Request Tracking**
```
Sending to gpt-4o-mini with system prompt (106 chars)
```
- **Debug Captions**: Confirms prompt length with each request
- **Token Usage**: Shows actual tokens used (prompt + completion)
- **Cost Tracking**: Real-time cost estimation per request

### **📊 Enhanced Validation**
- **Alignment Analysis**: Compares responses against critical chunks
- **System Prompt Impact**: Shows how your prompt guides LLM behavior
- **Validation Metrics**: Tracks prediction accuracy

## 🧪 **How to Test It**

### **1. Open the Demo**
Go to **http://localhost:8502**

### **2. Enter Your System Prompt**
```
## Main language:
You should always speak English

## Secondary language
You should always speak Spanish
```

### **3. Enable OpenAI Testing**
1. ✅ Check "Test with OpenAI"
2. 🔑 Enter your OpenAI API key
3. 📋 See "📄 System Prompt Being Tested" section appear
4. 🎯 Use default test questions or customize

### **4. Run Analysis**
Click "🚀 Analyze Attention Flow"

### **5. Verify System Prompt Usage**
In the "🤖 OpenAI Generation Test" section, you'll see:

#### **📄 System Prompt Being Tested**
```
## Main language:
You should always speak English

## Secondary language  
You should always speak Spanish

This system prompt (106 characters) will be sent to gpt-4o-mini
```

#### **🔍 Request Details**
For each test question:
```
Sending to gpt-4o-mini with system prompt (106 chars)
Tokens used: 45 (prompt: 32, completion: 13)
```

#### **📊 Response Analysis**
```
Response: "I primarily communicate in English as specified in my main language settings, though I can also respond in Spanish when requested based on my secondary language configuration."

Alignment Analysis:
- Chunk 1 (English): High alignment (4 overlapping keywords)
- Chunk 2 (Spanish): Medium alignment (2 overlapping keywords)

✅ Response aligns with 1 high-importance chunks - attention predictions validated!
```

## 🎯 **API Call Structure**

Your system prompt is sent exactly as written:

```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "## Main language:\nYou should always speak English\n\n## Secondary language\nYou should always speak Spanish"},
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is your primary language?"}
    ],
    max_tokens=150,
    temperature=0.7
)
```

## 📈 **What This Proves**

### **🔬 Attention Flow Validation**
- **Predictions vs Reality**: See if attention analysis matches actual LLM behavior
- **Chunk Importance**: Verify which parts of your prompt truly influence responses
- **Competition Detection**: Confirm if conflicting instructions create confused responses

### **💡 Optimization Insights**
Based on real OpenAI responses, you can:
1. **Reorder chunks** if low-importance sections dominate responses
2. **Emphasize critical parts** if they're not reflected in outputs
3. **Resolve conflicts** if responses show confusion between competing instructions
4. **Validate structure** by seeing how well responses align with predictions

## 🎊 **Success Metrics**

Your system now provides:
- ✅ **Static Analysis**: Mathematical predictions in seconds
- ✅ **Real Validation**: Actual OpenAI responses for comparison
- ✅ **Cost Tracking**: Token usage and cost estimation
- ✅ **Alignment Scoring**: Quantified prediction accuracy
- ✅ **Optimization Guidance**: Data-driven improvement suggestions

## 💰 **Cost Example**

Testing your 106-character system prompt:
```
📊 Key Metrics:
- System prompt: 106 characters (~26 tokens)
- 3 test questions: ~10 tokens each
- Responses: ~15 tokens each
- Total per test: ~51 tokens
- Cost with GPT-4o-mini: ~$0.01 per test session
```

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Test Different Prompts**: Try various structures and see prediction accuracy
2. **Optimize Based on Results**: Use alignment analysis to improve prompts
3. **Scale Testing**: Test multiple prompt variants efficiently
4. **Deploy with Confidence**: Use validated prompts in production
